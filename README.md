# MFCC linearSVM TEST
 
A program that extracts features with mel-log spectrum and finds the accuracy with deep learning.
 
# DEMO
 
"""Machine Learning TEST"""<br>
The accuracy and the loss was about `92.6%` and `0.234` respectively using k-fold cross-validation when the dataset of audio sample was as follows and output to Deep Learning of the machine learning algorithm.
